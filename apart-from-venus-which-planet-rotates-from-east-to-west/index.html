<p>Uranus� spin to an angle of 98 degrees. Hence, it tends to the reversal rotation of planet uranus. Uranus is the seventh planet orbiting the sun. Venus is the planet nearest to the earth.</p>
<h3 id="reason-venus-rotates-from-east-to-west">Reason venus rotates from east to west.</h3><p>What 2 planets rotate differently? Venus’s revolution cycle is once every 225 earth days, but it rotates clockwise with a period of 243 days. Only two planets venus and uranus revolve around the sun from east to west i.e. Why does the planet venus rotate from east to west, not the other way around like other planets? Hence on venus the sun will rise in the west and set in the east. That is to say, from west to east.</p>

<p>While other planets revolve around the from. It spins or rotates in the opposite direction that earth rotates. Venus is a notable exception to the counterclockwise rotation of the other planets. $\therefore$ venus and uranus are the planets that rotate from east to west.

<p>Venus spins on its axis from east to west, while uranus is tilted so far over, it�s virtually spinning on its side. $\therefore$ venus and uranus are the planets that rotate from east to west. Unlike the earth and most other planets, venus rotates on its axis from east to west, i.e. The temperature at the surface of the planet.</p>

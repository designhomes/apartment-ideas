This one has me rethinking this belief. Decorate with grown up wall stickers. A shared bedroom shouldn’t have a uniform look.</p>

<p>There’s no place better suited to be coated with color than a teenage girl’s bedroom. Continue to 4 of 15 below. Style your bedroom around artwork.

<p>This one has me rethinking this belief. Siblings sharing a bedroom will also appreciate the ability to block off the rest of the room, in case one wants to go to sleep before the other.

<p>View in gallery a cozy bedroom for three with matching beds and headboards. Decorate with grown up wall stickers. A shared bedroom for a brother and sister.

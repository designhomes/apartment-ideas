My apartment has 3 ports in the walls. But only 1 From reddit.com</p>
<p>I just moved into this new apartment. For wiring ethernet cable, the broadband connection usually being cable, dsl, or something else will first go through some kind of device typically called a modem. Despite advancements in wireless technology, there is still a need for ethernet cabling. Imagine it was cut with scissors.</p>
<h3 id="you-also-have-more-headroom-in-your-wifi-network-to-advance-your-smart-apartment">You also have more headroom in your wifi network to advance your smart apartment.</h3><p>More likely is you have a phone port in each room which are daisy chained together. T568a and t568b are the two standards for wiring ethernet cords, according to cnet. The rooms in my unit have ethernet ports installed. Establish a central switching area where i can install a switch, router and adsl modem. Might not be the most accurate info, i’ve only been in thailand for a few months. That�s what i tried first.</p>

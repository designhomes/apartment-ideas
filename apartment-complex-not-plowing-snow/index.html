<p>Maybe it is $200 every time they come out and plow your parking lot. It’s often a key part of snow removal for an apartment complex. While driving around today, we noticed nearly all apartment complex parking lots that we saw were in good shape, looking plowed and clear from snow. If not, you’ll need the snow hauled away, off.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that the management company that runs our complex and the one next to ours only have two small pickups with plow attachments working. I am on site every day because i manage the complexes but there must be a more effiecent way to plow apartment complexes. They tell us not to use the local weather or depend.</p>

<p>The salting/plowing truck for my apartment complex has a very unique issue. With a $750 buffer the bid would be $8250. I have just gone through the blizzard of 2016. Another example is to let tenants know that snow plowing will be done within the legal timeframe after snowfall and you are not obligated to make special arrangements for tenants.</p>

<p>As a renter, you might assume that your landlord is responsible for shoveling your snow, but that’s not necessarily true.

<p>I am on site every day because i manage the complexes but there must be a more effiecent way to plow apartment complexes. Maybe it is $200 every time they come out and plow your parking lot. In new jersey, associations and apartment complexes are responsible to clear snow and ice from sidewalks that are controlled by association/complex. The total.</p>

<p>Macintosh says he�s not heard many complaints. If you call us ahead of time, we can quickly provide you with the help that you need. My lease does not explicitly state that we, the tenants, are responsible for snow removal. The sidewalk in front of this particular apartment building was simply overlooked.

<p>I have handicap privileges and the snow plow has piled snow on my car and in front of the handicap space. I look at the job and see how long i think it will take me to do it with 4 of snow lets say 6hrs. While driving around today, we noticed nearly all apartment complex parking lots that we.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that the management company that runs our complex and the one next to ours only have two small pickups with plow attachments working. If you call us ahead of time, we can quickly provide you with the help that you need. Management must keep apartment walkways clear of snow and ice 2. The complex contracted snow plowing,.</p>

<p>This apartment has its own parking lot and we all have a spot in there. Typically, owners of residential property, such as a single family home, have no duty to remove or warn of snow and ice accumulation that has occurred naturally. There is a common driveway for 6 attached homes and each owner owns the part of the driveway.</p>

<p>For instance, your one time rate may cover 28 pushes or 30 pushes of snow. Please, use empty spaces around the complex to temporarily park. While driving around today, we noticed nearly all apartment complex parking lots that we saw were in good shape, looking plowed and clear from snow. My lease does not explicitly state that we, the tenants,.</p>

<p>Housing complex faces questions about snow removal. If “per push,” how much? I am bidding on a apartment complex. The driveway remains buried in snow as does the entrance/ exit to our home. It has a small privet road, and then 6 parking lots.</p>

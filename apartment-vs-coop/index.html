<p>In a condominium, the common areas are jointly owned by all the dwellers. First, condos are usually more expensive than coops because cooperatives are older and they represent 70% of the market.

<p>A coop is essentially an apartment building that’s owned by a corporation made up of the residents. The big distinctions for renters lie in approvals, required payments, and rules.

<p>The cooperative corporation is run by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. There is a property tax bill for each unit payable directly by the owner of the unit. Shares are assigned on the basis of the scale and floor level of the individual unit. A condo owner has to pay property taxes just as a homeowner does,.</p>

<p>Buying a condo means you own the real estate, including an interest in common areas like lawns. In a condominium, the common areas are jointly owned by all the dwellers. A condo is a real property while a coop is an intangible personal property. Coops, however, can make up any rules they want and their shareholders must adhere to those.</p>

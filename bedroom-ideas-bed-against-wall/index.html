<h3 id="a-daybed-can-help-create-the-illusion-that-the-room-is-more-of-a-small-sitting-area-instead-of-a-small-bedroom-thats-been-taken-over-by-a-bed">A daybed can help create the illusion that the room is more of a small sitting area, instead of a small bedroom that’s been taken over by a bed.</h3><p>The truth is you are creating another problem.

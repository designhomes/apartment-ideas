<p>For example a bank will lend to a new home buyer currently at 80% of the home’s value.but with apartments, it’s not so simple.

<p>The banc series™ apartment loan program is a dynamic mix of bank, investment bank and credit union balance sheet loan programs for 5+ unit multifamily properties and mobile home parks. After some googling, it seems quite common for smaller banks to refuse loans for small properties. Certainly not as bad as some of the studios/dog boxes that are being built.</p>

<p>Anz bank new zealand is changing its lending rules on small apartments to help more customers on to the property ladder. Banks will only lend 80% if the apartment is of a specific size. I currently rent a similarly sized apartment, and it�s a fine size for a single person. “in the case of smaller apartments (typically less than 50.</p>

<p>We absolutely love small apartment loans! If the bank is not going to lend the maximum lvr, with apartments they tend to default to 50%, but it depends on whether an apartment is. Not many banks will lend on loan amounts under $500,000. Certainly not as bad as some of the studios/dog boxes that are being built these days (this.</p>

<p>If it is lower than that size, the bank will only lend 50% of the apartment�s value. “in the case of smaller apartments (typically less than 50 square metres), it’s about ensuring customers are aware of the increased risk if the market changes, for these apartment types.
